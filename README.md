Hi there! I am an MS student from Cornell University, focusing on language model training and application.

I have recently been very interested in building efficient LLMs in interactive environments, specifically in game engines (2023-): [Voice2Action](https://github.com/yang-su2000/VR-Multimodal-Interaction)

I am also working on large-scale text retrieval and generation system with Prof. Alexander M. Rush at Cornell Tech (2023-): [Authorship Attribution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gz3ZR95sBKAnPyzTlQi5HqO8tzzE_qQs/view?usp=drive_link)

I used to work on graph machine learning & time series prediction at AWS AI Labs (2021-2022): [Deep Graph Library](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl)

I do some competitive programming for fun: [cout << "accepted" << endl;](https://codeforces.com/profile/shinever)

I enjoy cooking, listening to music of all forms, playing ping-pong, reading science fiction, and more!

<!-- Interned as a software engineer at the Amazon AI lab, I focused on using static and dynamic graph-structured data to improve downstream time-series tasks' performance and stability. I conducted academic research and industrial engineering solutions using knowledge graph embeddings and spatio-temporal graph neural networks to enhance AWS sales prediction results. Throughout the internship, I demonstrated the ability to develop technically sound and reliable software in real-world, large-scale applications. 

Currently, at Cornell Tech, I am interested in the field of natural language reasoning, including logical and factual text generation, the chain of thoughts, and LLM for code (reasoning in a formal system). I also help Prof Sasha Rush with the topic of authorship attribution, which aims to match the correct authorship with a given text by creating unique fingerprints of author-specific linguistic features. 

I love building machine learning software to support and automate various application areas. At the Cornell XR Collabroatory, our team designs ML-guided 3D multimodal creator tools in virtual and augmented reality to track user actions and predict their intents in real-time. The future goal is to accelerate the rendering cost in the game engine and make more user-friendly interaction tools for developers to work on.

Lastly, I have some side interests in competitive programming and always be attracted to new algorithms and coding techniques (check my CF/AC with the handle “shinever”!). During my free time, I enjoy strolling around, listening to music of all forms, reading science fiction, and playing ping-pong! -->
